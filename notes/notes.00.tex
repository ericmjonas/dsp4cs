\maketitle


This is an experiment. I need your feedback to make sure it's working
for you.


\section{Background}


Have you taken

A course on signals and systems
A DSP course
A stochastic process theory course
A linear algebra course
A differential equations course

Have you called fft in the past year



\section{Introduction}
The importance of consistent pedagogy -- $x(t)$ vs $x[n]$ 

The unimportance of formalism -- this is a rapid survey (drinking from the 
firehose) and the formalism sometimes gets in the way. That said, if you
wish to do actual work in this area, it's important to at least collaborate
with someone who knows it. 

\section{About Me}
I'm not a mathematician, or really even a computer scientist, but rather
just a guy who wants to build cool shit. 

\section{What we don't cover}
Only the tiniest bit of control theory
no stochastic process theory
no filter design
No advanced modulation theory


\section{Format}
8 lectures
heavy on background at first
Lots of neat examples
If you want supplemental material let me know

\section{What I hope to achieve}
1. Get people excited about these problems
2. in two years you remember enough keywords to intelligently google the right thing and not have the wikipedia page read like gibberish
3. Realize that computer science has been doing a lot of this stuff
forever, and that you really do have the background and skills to contribute.
