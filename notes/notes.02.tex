Not just another basis

Use example from encyclopedia of mathematics


* Spectral analysis. What is the relationship between the Fourier
  Transform, the Discrete-Time Fourier Transform, and the FFT? "Why
  does matlabâ€™s FFT() always give me complex outputs?" forward,
  inverse transforms.

\section{Analytic Signals}
Most signals in the real world are real-valued. 

Physicsists always say ``Well we can just use a complex signal and
then take the real part'' but

1. Why? 

2. Ok, there are a whole bunch of ways to create a complex signal from
a real one, why do we do it a certain way? 

3. I and Q -- quadrature signals

4. Negative Frequency
