\title{Signals and LTI Systems}


\section{Introduction}



\section{What is a signal }
Continuous time
Discrete time

Examples -- audio, RF, etc. 

Even and oddness



\section{Periodic Signals}
Phase


\section{Analytic Signals}
Most signals in the real world are real-valued. 

Physicsists always say ``Well we can just use a complex signal and
then take the real part'' but

1. Why? 

2. Ok, there are a whole bunch of ways to create a complex signal from
a real one, why do we do it a certain way? 

3. I and Q -- quadrature signals

4. Negative Frequency

\section{Linearity} 
Linear algebra rears its ugly haed 

\section{Convolution}
Basic operation of LTI systems

``Flip and slide'' 

Circulant and Toeplitz Matrices

\section{Dirac Delta Function}

Basis of an LTI system
